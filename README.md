# üçÑ Power Up via Memory
My project "Power Up via Memory" is a memory card matching game based off a theme of the original NES Super Mario Bros game.  The goal is to match pairs of the power up images by flipping over the cards & remembering their positons.  As you match cards you gain "coins" in the process.
